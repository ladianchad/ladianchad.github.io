\CVSectionHeader{Research Interests}
My research interests lie in \textbf{autonomous navigation}, \textbf{centralized multi-robot fleet management}, and \textbf{multi-agent path finding (MAPF)} in dynamic and uncertain environments involving humans, animals, and heterogeneous robotic systems. I am particularly interested in developing robust and flexible control formulations and optimal path finding strategies for multi-agent systems that enable scalable real-world deployment.
